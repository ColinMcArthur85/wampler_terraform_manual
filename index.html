            <p>
              Without doubt the WAMPLER TERRAFORM is the first of a new breed of
              pedals from WAMPLER. We’ve completely thrown ourselves into the
              realms of digital to bring you the best multi modulation pedal
              that is very easy to use, has all the essential features, and
              still carries that legendary Wampler tone.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ve taken 11 all original and custom designed modulation effects
              and put them inside one small footprint stompbox... we’ve made it
              fully programmable, true stereo, split mono (so you can separate
              effects from pre gain to post gain), given it midi control
              (including the ability to midi map and control Tap Tempo),
              presets, an expression input that you can assign to ANY of the
              parameters... And most importantly, we’ve made those 11 effects
              that sound better than you could have ever imagined and every bit
              Wampler.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don’t doubt for a minute that you hate reading manuals as much
              as we do, so we’ve tried to make this simple for you, we don’t
              really like talking in techy gibberish or blinding you with a
              bunch of nerdy stuff you literally have no interest in, so you
              won’t find any (much) here!
            </p>
            <p>

              TERRAFORM, go hit up the Wampler site and checkout some of the

                <i>
                  When just a single wave chorus isn’t enough for you, we add
                  some more. This doesn’t make it more chorusy (did I just make
                  a word up there?), it adds a lot of depth. If the chorus makes
                  your tone wet, the Dimension has the option to completely soak
                  it. Balance the BLEND control to find the point where it
                  washes over the signal to the amount that makes you happy, or
                  even the amount it makes you sea sick.

                    We all love it and I think at some point have used far too
                    much of this effect. The TERRAFORM is voiced to give you the
                    most control over your chorus as possible. If you love the
                    old Japanese style, roll that bass end off (VARIABLE), if
                    you love the vintage American style, roll it back in
                    (VARIABLE). Balance the BLEND to ensure it doesn’t wash over
                    too much, or totally wash over everything. Turn the BLEND up
                    fully clockwise to achieve a cool vibrato effect (secret
                    effect block right there, free of charge, you’re welcome!)

                  This is the secret weapon of so many tremolo sounds, it’s wet,
                  kinda like a Rotary but without all the rotation stuff.
                  Perfect for bringing out the funk, quite the exclusive tone.
                  Use the VARIABLE control to see how far you want to push the
                  width and balance it with the BLEND, finding the sweet spot
                  between those two is the key to achieving the perfect Harmonic
                  Tremolo effect. The DEPTH control is your friend here, minimum
                  is almost none, near maximum is full sine wave and when you
                  have that depth control all the way round CW, you have a total
                  choppy Squarewave.

                    The power of the ROTARY is in the ramp. Switching between
                    the ‘resting state’ (which is lots of rotations a second) on
                    slow and ‘BOOM’ (which is lots more rotations a second) on
                    fast, is what makes it sound so awesome. Finding that ramp
                    speed is key, once you have found it, you can make your
                    chord changes pop as the rotary speeds up or slows down as
                    you do move across the song. With a little natural speaker
                    compression and grit thrown in as well, you have that full
                    ROTARY cabinet at your feet, but without the backache.

                  Finally, a Wampler Vibe effect. We’ve made this as wet as
                  possible, with the control over the thump that we all know and
                  love. When you have the VARIABLE control set up towards the CW
                  position, that classic Vibe thump is there. Perfect for
                  running into a dirty signal. When it’s more CWW, the higher
                  part of the wave is bought forward, making it a much cleaner
                  and more subtle effect. Find your place. Turn up the Vibe and
                  party like it’s 1967, baby.

                  wet, or even a 100/0 balance, finding the right point on your
                  BLEND control allows the PHASER to sit within your tone,
                  now... it can sit right on top, in the background or just

                  control, as the natural place, you would think, is to put it
                  straight up at noon. This MAY make it overbearing, so drop it
                  down so it’s not dominating the sound. Don’t be surprised if
                  you have it MUCH lower than you think, it’s perfectly natural.
                  The VARIABLE controls the type of whoosh you get, and the

                TERRAFORM to place certain effects in different places within

                Place the NORMAL/PRE POST switch to
                <strong><i>NORMAL</i></strong> If you are lucky enough to be
                running a full stereo rig, or even a wet/dry/wet rig, the
                TERRAFORM will make your tone ENORMOUS. We’ve examined every
                effect individually to make sure they exist and perform in the
                best possible way in stereo. You will experience the kind of
                washy tones that will surround you, engulf you and make you feel
                like you are swimming in a glorious spring water pool of
                delicious modulated wetness. And yes, I did just say that,
                because... well, it’s true. Open your sound, open your amps up,
                and get those swimming shorts on. It’s time to go for a dip.

                Place the NORMAL/PRE POST switch to
                <strong><i>NORMAL</i></strong> If you don’t have two amps, you
                can still enjoy the depth of the TERRAFORM. Simply plug your
                input signal into the PRE/L jack, and use either output jack to
                your amp.

              To make the most of assigning individual effects into specific
              places in your mono signal chain, it’s time to explore the
              PRE/POST options. For example, a lot of players like their U VIBE
              before their gain stages (whether that be an amps preamp stage, or
              their favorite dirt pedal) and the CHORUS after (again, either in
              the effects loop of the amp or after their dirt pedals. You can
              program the TERRAFORM (in PRE/POST mode) to place each effect
              either PRE or POST.
            </p>
            <p>
              The TERRAFORM ships with some effects pre and some post, here is
              how they are when you first fire it up.

                To assign the effects into be either PRE or POST globally,
                please follow these ridiculously simple steps.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Disconnect the TERRAFORM from power.</li>
                <li>
                  Simultaneously hold down both the BYPASS stomp and the TAP
                  TEMPO stomp.
                </li>
                <li>Power up the TERRAFORM.</li>
                <li>
                  Turn the PROGRAM CONTROL dial to the effect you want to place,
                  one of the program LEDs will begin to blink, and the bypass
                  LED will light either green or blue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To set the highlighted program to “Pre Mode”, press the BYPASS
                  stomp. The BYPASS LED will light green.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To set the highlighted program to “Post Mode”, press the TAP
                  TEMPO stomp. The BYPASS LED will light blue
                </li>
                <li>Repeat steps 4-6 for each program.</li>
                <li>
                  Once customization is complete, press the Preset Switch to
                  save the new Pre/Post Mode settings./li>
                </li>

                <li>
                  The BYPASS LED and TAP TEMPO LED will light green when saving
                  is complete. Remove power re-apply power to pedal to resume
                  normal use.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Those of you who are eagle-eyed will have noticed we said
                “global” when talking about allocating PRE/POST – this is how
                each effect is placed by default. But... if you desire... you
                can go one stage further and allocate each effects in its
                PRE/POST position according to each preset ... so, no matter
                where you have placed the effect globally, you can change it to
                the other ‘side’ for any particular preset!
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="half-container flow">
            <p>Here's how you do it...</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Set the effect settings the way you’d like, and then press and
                hold the preset button to initiate a preset save.
              </li>
              <li>
                While the preset LEDs are blinking, the bypass LED will light
                green or blue to indicate the pre or post position of the
                current effect.
                <strong>This will most likely reflect the global setting</strong
                >.
              </li>
              <li>
                Press the bypass switch to assign the preset to “pre”, or the
                tap tempo switch to assign it to “post”. The bypass LED will
                change color accordingly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Press and hold the preset switch to save the preset (along with
                the new pre/post setting).
              </li>
              <li>
                Now, when you load the preset you just saved, the pre/post
                setting will be loaded with it, instead of the global pre/post
                setting for that effect.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> this new pre/post setting only applies to
                the preset that was just saved. Using the program knob to change
                programs will load the global pre/post setting for each effect.
                Please see the respective section to change the global pre/post
                setting.

            <div>
              <p>
                You can assign an external expression pedal to control ANY of
                the 5 knobs on the TERRAFORM. This information is also stored
                within a patch, so when you program the TERRAFORM to recognize
                an expression pedal, each patch will remember how you want the
                expression to react, or you can use it on the fly.
              </p>

              <p>
                To configure the expression pedal, all you have to do is this.
              </p>
            </div>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Press and hold the BYPASS stomp, and then press the TAP TEMPO
                stomp. The TAP TEMPO LED will flash RED (release both switches
                immediately).
              </li>
              <li>
                Move the desired control to the first position. This will be the
                “heel” position of your expression pedal.
              </li>
              <li>
                Press the TAP TEMPO stomp. The TAP TEMPO LED will blink in
                response. Move the same control to the final position. This will
                be the “toe” position of your expression pedal.
              </li>
              <li>
                Press the TAP TEMPO stomp. The TAP TEMPO LED will blink in
                response and return to its normal color. Your expression pedal
                setting is now saved!
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <strong><i>Note:</i></strong> Be sure to save your preset soon

                The TERRAFORM has 8 preset locations for you to save your
                favorite sounds. You’ll see that there are 4 LED’s above the
                preset switch. Presets 1-4 are shown with the 1 LED on and three
                off, 5-8 are 3 on and 1 off.

              <h3>Saving a preset</h3>
              <p>
                Saving a preset is simple, of course it is, it’s the TERRAFORM.
                Just follow these steps.
              </p>
            </div>
            <ol>
              <li>(Optional) Configure Expression Pedal (see above).</li>
              <li>Set all the controls to the desired setting.</li>
              <li>
                Press and hold the Preset Switch until the Preset LEDs begin to
                blink.
              </li>
              <li>
                Press the Preset Switch until the desired preset location is
                indicated by the Preset LEDs.
              </li>
              <li>
                (Optional) To associate a preset with a MIDI program change,
                send the MIDI program change from your MIDI device to the
                Terraform before the step 6. The Terraform will switch to the
                saved preset whenever it receives that MIDI program change.
              </li>
              <li>
                Press and hold the Preset Switch until the Preset LEDs blink to
                indicate that the preset has been saved.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>There are three ways to recall a preset.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Press the PRESET switch to scroll through the 8 presets.</li>
              <li>
                Hold down the TAP TEMPO stomp until the LED changes to green.
                You can then use the TAP TEMPO stomp to scroll through the 8
                presets. To return to normal TAP TEMPO mode, hold down the TAP
                TEMPO stomp until the LED changes back to blue.
              </li>
              <li>
                Recall the preset via a MIDI preset change via a MIDI
                controller.
              </li>
              Recall the preset via a MIDI preset change via a MIDI controller.

                Many players are already some way down the road when it comes to
                using MIDI within their rigs, but also there are a lot that see
                the word MIDI and run to the hills. The MIDI applications within
                the TERRAFORM are really easy, you can recall a patch from the
                fully midi-mappable memory bank of the TERRAFORM and control the
                tap tempo speed.
              </p>

              <h3>Midi Papping</h3>
              <p>
                You can associate ANY incoming preset change of midi between 1-
                128 to any of the 8 preset locations. So, if you have 4 songs
                that you want a nice chorus, you don’t have to create 4
                different patches (like some other bigger box modulation units
                we can think of) you can just point the TERRAFORM to call up
                that one patch from those separate incoming midi patch change
                commands. As listed above, during the SAVING A PRESET process,
                step 5 gives the TERRAFORM the midi information it requires to
                recall a patch. Just send the program change information from
                the midi controller during this step and the TERRAFORM will
                remember it.

                You’ll be delighted to know that this will be the most sparse
                section in the manual, as there isn’t a lot to talk about. Here
                it is in full.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>PROGRAMMING CHANGE:</strong> To change the preset, send
                a MIDI program change on any channel with the desired program as
                the program byte. Example: PC 8 -> loads preset stored in patch
                8
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>TAP TEMPO:</strong> To trigger a tap tempo press, send a
                MIDI control change on any channel with 81 and 0 as the
                controller and value bytes. Example: CC 81 0 -> triggers tap
                tempo
              </p>

              </div>

              <p>
                The TERRAFORM communicates with TRS type A cables (Tip = 5, Ring
                = 4, Sleeve = 2.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>MIDI BYPASS:</strong> To assign “bypass” to a MIDI
                program change, press and hold the preset switch (as if you were
                saving a preset). Press the preset switch until all four preset
                LEDs blink simultaneously. Send a MIDI program change to the
                TERRAFORM. Press and hold the preset switch to assign “bypass”
                to that MIDI program change number. This does not affect any of
                the saved presets; it only links the program change and
                bypassing the TERRAFORM. Sending that program change number will
                now bypass the Terraform.
              </p>

              <h3>MIDI Channel</h3>
              <p>
                The TERRAFORM can be configured to respond to any of the 16 midi
                channels 1-16, or all of them (omni mode). The default is omni
                mode, so you will get an instant response from midi inputs. To
                change this, power off TERRAFORM, hold preset switch, and then
                power on and release the preset switch. the preset LEDs will
                display the current channel number in binary+1 (channel 1 = 0
                LEDs, channel 2 is the right most LED, channel 3 is the third
                LED, etc). Omni mode is when all 4 LED sweep through. Press the
                preset switch to cycle up the channels, and then hold for 5
                seconds when the desired channel is selected. This will save the
                required channel and restart the TERRAFORM.

                As we’ve packed a lot of variables into the TERRAFORM, it’s easy
                to feel intimidated by the fact the LED’s keep changing color.
                Here is your quick reference guide to understand what your
                TERRAFORM is telling you.

                and PRESET button at power up. The LED’s will turn red... Then
                restart the TERRAFORM and it resets to the factory settings!

            Some things for you to try out... but remember, this is according to
            the person who found them, with their guitar, with their amp and
            most importantly, their fingers. They are not intended to be a
            definitive collection of nailed tones, just a representation
            designed to give you a flavor of what the TERRAFORM can do!
          </p>
          <p>
            The volume was set at ‘unity’ for these, you will probably need it
            in a different position on your own rig... so, dig in, take these as
            a basic guide and dive into the watery depths of the TERRAFORM!

          <h2>Warranty / Power Requirements</h2>
          <h3>Power Requirements</h3>
          <p>
